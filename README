ESGE, a crossplatform 2D game engine for embedded systems.

This game engine consists of abstract classes following a
template pattern. These classes need to be implemented to
represent game objects, giving to them diverse functionalities.
Furthermore, an API is included for resource management, like
files, scenes, sprite sheets, animations, sounds, and music. Has a
scene editor to allow the creation and modification of scenes,
along with their respective objects. Ultimately, the engine
culminates in generating the game's executable, which implements
its main loop.
